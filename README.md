# CodeLab-1

This repository holds the answers in response to the exercises found in CodeLab1.

*Navigating the respository*
The repository is ordered into folders in accordance to the chapter numbers found on the class repsoitory for Github. In each of these are the exercise solutions. 
For most tasks, the code is the raw code from the solutions. This is my own work, but I found it easier to demonstrate it in this way as I had issues with using the 
original github repository and pushing files from my computer. I used an online IDE as I found this an easier space to work in. The online IDE I used was 
Repl.it. This code should be easily copy and pasted to be tested, and should work in any IDE, but I'm also happy to provide files if this isn't the way this should 
be submitted. 

For some solutions, I have used visual C++, and these files have been pushed directly from my computer along with their debug files. This should be able to run 
independently on any computer that has Visual Studio enabled, but I haven't been able to test it. If this becomes an issue, I am more than happy to demonstrate my 
code working in class. 

Please do let me know if there's any problems with the repository. I understand that I may have gone wrong in the set up and will be happy to fix this :)

*Quirks of the code*
My code is written in a slightly different format to that found in the CodeLab lessons. It still works as intended - These are just things that I prefer using
or got adjusted to using when learning.

Use of STD - Whilst still declaring the use of the standard namespace at the top of most of the programs, I still favour to use std at the start of cin/cout. 
             This has no influence on the code - this is just the way I learnt to code in C++ and old habits die hard!

Null use of endl - I've tested my programs both with and without the use of endl, and it didn't seem to make a difference thus far in the exercises I've completed. To 
                   avoid more errors than necessary, I elected not to use it.
